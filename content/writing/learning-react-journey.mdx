# My React Learning Journey

When I decided to build this portfolio website, I knew I wanted to use React. But I had never used it before. This post documents my learning journey.

## Why React?

I chose React because:

- It's widely used in the industry
- Component-based architecture makes sense to me
- Large community and ecosystem
- Skills transfer to React Native for mobile development

## Resources I Used

### Free Resources

1. **React Documentation** - The new React docs are excellent
2. **FreeCodeCamp** - Great for fundamentals
3. **YouTube tutorials** - Visual learning helps

### Paid Resources

1. **Udemy courses** - Comprehensive but can be outdated
2. **Frontend Masters** - High quality content

## The Learning Path

### Week 1-2: JavaScript Fundamentals

Before diving into React, I made sure I understood:

- ES6+ syntax (arrow functions, destructuring, spread operator)
- Array methods (map, filter, reduce)
- Async/await and Promises

### Week 3-4: React Basics

I started with the fundamentals:

```jsx
// My first React component
function Welcome({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}
```

Understanding JSX was the first hurdle. It's not HTML, but it looks like it!

### Week 5-6: State and Effects

The `useState` hook became my best friend:

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Clicked {count} times
    </button>
  );
}
```

## Common Mistakes I Made

1. **Mutating state directly** - Always use the setter function!
2. **Missing key props** - React needs keys for list items
3. **Overusing state** - Not everything needs to be state
4. **Not reading error messages** - They're actually helpful!

## Building the Portfolio

After 6 weeks of learning, I felt ready to build this portfolio. I chose:

- **Next.js** - React framework with great features
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **Framer Motion** - Smooth animations

## Tips for Beginners

1. **Build projects** - Tutorial hell is real. Build things!
2. **Read documentation** - It's often better than tutorials
3. **Join communities** - Discord servers and Reddit are helpful
4. **Be patient** - Learning takes time

## Conclusion

Learning React was challenging but rewarding. The key is consistent practice and building real projects. This portfolio is proof that you can learn and create something meaningful!
