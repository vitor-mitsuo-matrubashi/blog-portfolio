# Building a Scientific Calculator to Learn React

When I decided to learn React, I knew I needed a project that was **simple enough to understand** but **complex enough to teach real concepts**. That's when I decided to build a scientific calculator from scratch.

## Why a Calculator?

A calculator is the perfect learning project because:

1. **Clear scope** - Everyone knows what a calculator should do
2. **Incremental complexity** - Start with basic math, add scientific functions later
3. **Visual feedback** - You see results immediately
4. **Full-stack opportunity** - Can add a backend for complex calculations

## The Tech Stack

I chose technologies that are widely used in the industry:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI
- **Styling**: CSS Grid and Flexbox

### Why TypeScript?

TypeScript adds type safety to JavaScript. Instead of discovering bugs at runtime, the compiler catches them while you code:

```typescript
// Without TypeScript - bug discovered at runtime
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
add("5", 3); // Returns "53" instead of 8!

// With TypeScript - bug caught immediately
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}
add("5", 3); // Error: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable
```

### Why FastAPI?

I wanted to learn how frontend and backend communicate. FastAPI is:

- **Fast** to write and run
- **Easy** to understand
- **Well documented**
- **Type-safe** with Python type hints

## Key Concepts I Learned

### 1. React Components

Everything in React is a component. The calculator has:

- `Calculator.tsx` - Main container
- `Display.tsx` - Shows the current number/result
- `Button.tsx` - Each calculator button

### 2. React Hooks

Hooks let you use state and other React features:

```tsx
// useState - Store and update values
const [display, setDisplay] = useState("0");

// useCallback - Memoize functions
const handleClick = useCallback((value: string) => {
  setDisplay(prev => prev + value);
}, []);
```

### 3. Custom Hooks

I created `useCalculator.ts` to separate logic from UI:

```tsx
function useCalculator() {
  const [display, setDisplay] = useState("0");
  const [memory, setMemory] = useState<number | null>(null);
  
  const calculate = () => { /* math logic */ };
  const clear = () => setDisplay("0");
  
  return { display, calculate, clear };
}
```

### 4. API Communication

The frontend sends calculation requests to the backend:

```tsx
const result = await fetch("http://localhost:8000/calculate", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ expression: "sin(45)" }),
});
```

### 5. CORS Configuration

Browsers block requests between different origins. FastAPI needs CORS middleware:

```python
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["http://localhost:3000"],
    allow_methods=["*"],
)
```

## Challenges I Faced

### Keyboard Support

Adding keyboard support taught me about event listeners:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const handleKeyDown = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
    if (e.key >= "0" && e.key <= "9") {
      addDigit(e.key);
    } else if (e.key === "Enter") {
      calculate();
    }
  };
  
  window.addEventListener("keydown", handleKeyDown);
  return () => window.removeEventListener("keydown", handleKeyDown);
}, []);
```

### State Management

Keeping track of:
- Current display value
- Previous operand
- Selected operator
- Whether to clear on next input

This taught me to think carefully about **what state is needed** and **when it should change**.

## What's Next?

Now that I understand the basics, I want to:

1. Add more scientific functions (factorial, logarithms)
2. Implement calculation history
3. Add unit conversions
4. Create a mobile-responsive design

## Conclusion

Building a calculator might seem simple, but it touches on **every fundamental concept** in React:

- Components and props
- State management with hooks
- Event handling
- API integration
- Styling with CSS

If you're learning React, I highly recommend building something hands-on. The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/vitor-mitsuo-matrubashi/scientific-calculador) with detailed comments explaining every concept.

**The best way to learn is by doing!** 🚀
