# My Website

My personal corner of the internet to showcase projects and share knowledge.

## Features

- **Dark theme** with red accents
- **MDX blog** with syntax highlighting
- **Responsive design** that works on all devices
- **Fast loading** thanks to Next.js optimization
- **SEO optimized** for better discoverability

## Technical Stack

- **Next.js 14** with App Router
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Contentlayer** for MDX processing
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **Vercel** for hosting

## Why I Built This

I wanted a space to:

1. Document my learning journey
2. Showcase my projects
3. Practice web development
4. Practice multiple languages (Polyglot Notes!)
